    "# Integrated Energy System Planning (IESP)\n",
    "The application domain of Integrated Energy System Planning (IESP) is a field that describes the energy system in mathematical models typically formulated as optimization problems. Solving energy planning tasks is essential in the transition to climate neutrality of regional and global energy systems, providing decision support to policymakers by gaining insights into complex interactions and dynamics of increasingly integrated energy systems, e.g., see [Schmitz et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12667-023-00595-y), [Böttger and Härtel 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105709), [Craig et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.05.010), [Frischmuth et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/EEM54602.2022.9921154).\n",

    "The planning problems corresponding to large-scale energy systems (easily up to 100 million decision variables) are typically formulated\n",
    "as continuous linear programming (LP) problems. Note that there are many non-linear and non-convex properties in energy systems. However, especially in long-term analyses with a large geographical scope, modeling applications apply simplifications, abstractions, and approximations. They resort to (convex) linear programming formulations to reduce the computational burden."
